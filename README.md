# Inside the Numbers: Unveiling Insights from MLB Data

This project explores Major League Baseball betting data to uncover patterns in odds, pitcher performance, and scoring trends.
The main `MLB.ipynb` notebook walks through several stories:

- Visualizes how shifts between opening and closing lines relate to game outcomes.
- Evaluates pitcher performance and identifies undervalued or overvalued players.
- Adds an interactive 3D scatter plot comparing average opening odds, closing odds, and win percentage for each pitcher, helping spot clusters of similar performers and outliers who defy betting expectations.
- Studies inning-by-inning scoring to reveal when early leads matter most.

To explore the notebook and its visuals, install the required packages and launch Jupyter:

```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib plotly openpyxl
jupyter notebook MLB.ipynb
```

The combination of traditional charts and interactive 3D views provides a richer perspective on how betting markets and on-field
performance intersect in the MLB.
